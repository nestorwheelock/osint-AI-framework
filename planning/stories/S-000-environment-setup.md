# S-000: Pre-Epoch Environment Design & Infrastructure Setup

**Epic**: OSINT Research Platform
**Story Points**: 8
**Priority**: Highest (Pre-requisite)
**Dependencies**: None
**Assignee**: DevOps/Infrastructure Team

## Story Description

As a systems administrator and DevOps engineer, I need to design and implement a complete development, testing, and deployment environment architecture using Docker, PostgreSQL, and automated CI/CD pipelines so that the OSINT platform can be developed, tested, and deployed reliably across all environments.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Environment Architecture
- [ ] Complete environment architecture documented (dev, staging, prod)
- [ ] Docker-based development environment with hot reloading
- [ ] PostgreSQL database configuration and schema management
- [ ] Automated installation and setup scripts
- [ ] GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline configuration
- [ ] Infrastructure as Code (IaC) documentation

### Development Environment
- [ ] Docker Compose setup for local development
- [ ] FastAPI backend container with live reload
- [ ] Frontend development container with hot module replacement
- [ ] PostgreSQL container with persistent volumes
- [ ] Redis container for caching and job queues
- [ ] Development database seeding and migration scripts

### Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] Automated testing pipeline in GitHub Actions
- [ ] Test database containers and fixtures
- [ ] Code coverage reporting and thresholds
- [ ] Security scanning integration
- [ ] Performance testing setup

### Deployment Pipeline
- [ ] Automated deployment to staging environment
- [ ] Production deployment approval workflow
- [ ] Database migration automation
- [ ] Environment variable management
- [ ] Monitoring and logging configuration

## Technical Specifications

### Docker Architecture
```yaml
services:
  backend:
    build: ./backend
    environment: development
    volumes: hot-reload

  frontend:
    build: ./frontend
    environment: development
    volumes: hot-reload

  database:
    image: postgresql:15
    volumes: persistent-data

  redis:
    image: redis:7-alpine
    volumes: persistent-cache
```

### Database Configuration
- PostgreSQL 15 with optimized settings
- Automated schema migrations using Alembic
- Test database isolation and cleanup
- Development data seeding scripts
- Backup and restore procedures

### CI/CD Pipeline Stages
1. **Code Quality**: Linting, formatting, security scanning
2. **Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, E2E tests
3. **Build**: Docker image building and optimization
4. **Deploy**: Automated deployment with rollback capability

## AI Coding Brief

**SECURITY REQUIREMENT**: NEVER include author attribution in any generated code, comments, or documentation.

Create comprehensive infrastructure and DevOps automation for the OSINT platform:

1. **Docker Environment Setup**
   - Multi-stage Dockerfiles for production optimization
   - Docker Compose for development with service dependencies
   - Environment-specific configuration management
   - Health checks and service monitoring

2. **Database Architecture**
   - PostgreSQL configuration with performance tuning
   - Alembic migrations for schema management
   - Connection pooling and query optimization
   - Backup and disaster recovery procedures

3. **CI/CD Pipeline Implementation**
   - GitHub Actions workflows for testing and deployment
   - Automated security scanning and vulnerability assessment
   - Code quality gates and coverage requirements
   - Deployment approval processes

4. **Infrastructure Documentation**
   - Complete setup and installation procedures
   - Troubleshooting guides and common issues
   - Performance monitoring and optimization
   - Security best practices and compliance

## Test Plan

### Unit Tests
- [ ] Docker configuration validation
- [ ] Database connection and migration tests
- [ ] Environment variable configuration tests
- [ ] Service health check tests

### Integration Tests
- [ ] Full stack Docker Compose startup
- [ ] Database schema migration testing
- [ ] Service communication and dependencies
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline execution tests

### Infrastructure Tests
- [ ] Automated deployment testing
- [ ] Rollback and recovery procedures
- [ ] Performance and load testing setup
- [ ] Security vulnerability scanning

## Technical Notes

### Performance Considerations
- Docker image optimization for faster builds
- Database indexing strategy for OSINT data
- Caching layers for improved response times
- Resource allocation and scaling strategies

### Security Requirements
- Container security hardening
- Database access controls and encryption
- Secrets management for API keys and credentials
- Network security and service isolation

### Monitoring and Observability
- Application and infrastructure monitoring
- Centralized logging with structured formats
- Error tracking and alerting systems
- Performance metrics and dashboards

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Complete Docker development environment running
- [ ] PostgreSQL database configured and accessible
- [ ] Automated installation scripts tested and documented
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline successfully deploying to staging
- [ ] All infrastructure documentation complete and reviewed
- [ ] Security scanning integrated and passing
- [ ] Performance baselines established and documented
