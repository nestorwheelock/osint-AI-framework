## AI Coding Brief

**SECURITY REQUIREMENT**: NEVER include author attribution in any generated code, comments, or documentation.

Integrate and finalize the complete OSINT research platform:

1. **System Integration**
   - Combine all feature modules into cohesive application
   - Implement cross-feature data sharing and workflows
   - Ensure consistent error handling and logging
   - Validate API contracts and data models

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement database connection pooling and query optimization
   - Add Redis caching for frequently accessed data
   - Optimize frontend bundle size and implement code splitting
   - Configure CDN and static asset optimization

3. **Security Implementation**
   - Implement comprehensive authentication and authorization
   - Add input validation and sanitization middleware
   - Configure security headers and HTTPS enforcement
   - Implement audit logging for security events

4. **Production Deployment**
   - Configure production environment variables
   - Implement health checks and service monitoring
   - Set up automated backup and recovery procedures
   - Create operational runbooks and troubleshooting guides
