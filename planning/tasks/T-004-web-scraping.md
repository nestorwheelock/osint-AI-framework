# T-004 â€” Tasks for S-004: Playwright Web Scraping

## Prerequisites
- [ ] Confirm requirements against PRD [link](../../docs/product/osint-platform.md)
- [ ] Review web scraping architecture [link](../../docs/design/osint-platform.md)
- [ ] Understand Playwright capabilities and browser automation

## Playwright Setup and Configuration
- [ ] Install Playwright dependencies and browser binaries
- [ ] Create browser configuration service with settings management
- [ ] Implement browser pool management for concurrent scraping
- [ ] Configure headless browser settings and viewport options
- [ ] Set up user agent rotation and stealth configurations

## WebPage Data Model
- [ ] Create WebPage SQLAlchemy model in `backend/app/models/webpage.py`
  - UUID primary key, subject/session foreign keys
  - URL fields (original, canonical, final after redirects)
  - File paths for HTML, screenshots, PDFs
  - Metadata fields (title, description, status, timestamps)
- [ ] Create database migration for WebPage table
- [ ] Add relationships to Subject and Session models

## Core Scraping Service
- [ ] Implement PageScraper class in `backend/app/services/scraper/`
  - async page fetching with Playwright
  - JavaScript rendering and network idle waiting
  - Screenshot capture with proper sizing
  - PDF generation for page content
  - Error handling for timeouts and failures
- [ ] Create file storage service for HTML/screenshots/PDFs
  - Organized directory structure by date
  - File naming conventions with UUIDs
  - Storage cleanup and management

## API Implementation
- [ ] Create scraping endpoints in `backend/app/routes/subjects.py`
  - POST /subjects/{subject_id}/fetch - Accept URL list
  - GET /subjects/{subject_id}/pages - List fetched pages
  - GET /pages/{page_id} - Get page details
  - GET /pages/{page_id}/screenshot - Download screenshot
  - GET /pages/{page_id}/pdf - Download PDF
- [ ] Add request validation using Pydantic schemas
- [ ] Implement proper HTTP status codes and error responses

## Error Handling and Resilience
- [ ] Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- [ ] Handle various failure scenarios (timeouts, 404s, network errors)
- [ ] Add circuit breaker pattern for failing domains
- [ ] Log detailed error information for debugging
- [ ] Graceful degradation when Playwright unavailable

## Testing Implementation
- [ ] Write unit tests for scraping service in `backend/app/tests/test_scraper.py`
  - Mock Playwright for isolated testing
  - Test error scenarios and edge cases
  - Verify file storage and database persistence
- [ ] Create integration tests with real browser automation
  - Test against known stable websites
  - Verify screenshot and PDF generation
  - Test concurrent scraping scenarios
- [ ] Add E2E tests for complete workflow
  - Test API endpoints end-to-end
  - Verify UI integration for scraping requests

## Performance and Scalability
- [ ] Implement concurrent scraping with proper resource limits
- [ ] Add request queuing for large URL lists
- [ ] Monitor memory usage and browser resource cleanup
- [ ] Configure timeouts and resource limits
- [ ] Optimize file storage and database operations

## Documentation and Cleanup
- [ ] Update API documentation with scraping endpoints
- [ ] Document browser configuration options
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guide for common issues
- [ ] Clean up any debug code or temporary files

## Definition of Done Verification
- [ ] All tests pass: `pytest backend/app/tests/test_scraper.py -v`
- [ ] API endpoints return correct status codes and data
- [ ] Browser automation works reliably across different sites
- [ ] File storage and database operations are working
- [ ] Error handling covers common failure scenarios
- [ ] Code follows project conventions [link](../../standards/conventions.md)
