# Mobile Strategy: React Native Direction & Cross-Platform Architecture

**Document Type**: RFC (Request for Comments) - Strategic Direction
**Version**: 1.0
**Date**: September 28, 2025
**Status**: Proposed
**Scope**: OSINT AI Framework & Django TDD Template

---

## Executive Summary

This RFC proposes adopting React as our primary frontend technology with a clear path to mobile application development through React Native and Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities. This strategic direction leverages our existing React foundation to provide comprehensive cross-platform coverage while maximizing code reuse and development efficiency.

## Problem Statement

Modern software applications require multi-platform deployment to maximize user reach and business value. Traditional approaches require separate development teams, codebases, and maintenance overhead for web, iOS, and Android platforms. Our OSINT AI Framework and future client projects need:

1. **Web application** for desktop and tablet users
2. **Mobile applications** for field work and on-the-go access
3. **Offline capabilities** for unreliable network environments
4. **Native mobile features** (camera, GPS, push notifications)
5. **Consistent user experience** across all platforms
6. **Efficient development and maintenance** with limited resources

## Proposed Solution: React Ecosystem Strategy

### **Core Technology Decision: React**

**Rationale**: React provides the optimal foundation for cross-platform development with maximum code reuse and a unified development experience.

### **Multi-Platform Deployment Strategy**

```
React Foundation (Web)
 Progressive Web App (PWA) - Mobile Web
 React Native - Native Mobile Apps
 Capacitor - Hybrid Mobile Apps
 Electron - Desktop Apps (future consideration)
```

  list: () => api.get('/api/subjects/'),
  create: (data) => api.post('/api/subjects/', data),
  // ... same for all platforms
}

// Business Logic Hooks - 95% reusable
export const useSubjectManager = () => {
  const [subjects, setSubjects] = useState([])
  // ... logic works on web and mobile
}

// TypeScript Types - 100% reusable
interface Subject {
  id: string
  name: string
  // ... same types everywhere
}
```

**Platform-Specific Components** (UI layer only):
```typescript
// Web Version
import { Button } from '@mui/material'
<Button onClick={handleSave}>Save Subject</Button>

// React Native Version
import { Button } from 'react-native-paper'
<Button onPress={handleSave}>Save Subject</Button>
```
