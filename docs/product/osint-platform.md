# OSINT Platform â€” Product Requirements Document

## Problem
OSINT researchers need a comprehensive platform to efficiently collect, analyze, and organize information from multiple web sources. Current manual processes are time-consuming, error-prone, and don't scale well for complex investigations.

## Users & Use Cases
**Primary Users:**
- Security analysts conducting threat intelligence research
- Journalists investigating stories requiring public records and web data
- Academic researchers studying online information patterns
- Legal professionals gathering evidence from public sources

**Key Use Cases:**
- Multi-source web search and data collection
- Automated content extraction and entity identification
- Timeline reconstruction from scattered web sources
- Export of findings in structured formats for reports

## Goals / Success Metrics
- **Efficiency**: Reduce manual research time by 70% through automation
- **Accuracy**: Achieve 95%+ accuracy in entity extraction and deduplication
- **Coverage**: Support 10+ search engines and data sources
- **Usability**: Enable non-technical users to complete investigations independently
- **Compliance**: Maintain ethical scraping practices and respect robots.txt

## Scope (In)
- Web search aggregation across multiple engines
- Automated page fetching with Playwright
- Text extraction and language detection
- Entity extraction using AI pipelines
- Subject-based organization and session management
- Export capabilities (JSONL, PDF reports)
- Basic labeling and filtering functionality
- Ethical scraping controls and rate limiting

## Out of Scope
- Real-time monitoring or alerting
- Social media API integrations (Twitter, Facebook, etc.)
- Image analysis or computer vision features
- Advanced visualization or dashboard creation
- Multi-user collaboration features
- Enterprise authentication systems

## Constraints & Assumptions
- **Technical**: FastAPI backend, Playwright for web scraping, PostgreSQL database
- **Legal**: Must respect robots.txt and Terms of Service
- **Performance**: Handle up to 1000 pages per investigation
- **Budget**: Open source solution, minimal external API costs
- **Timeline**: MVP delivery in 4-6 weeks

## Rollout & Risks
**Rollout Plan:**
1. MVP with core features (US-001 through US-010)
2. Beta testing with select OSINT community members
3. Public release with documentation and tutorials

**Key Risks:**
- **Legal**: Potential scraping restrictions from target sites
- **Technical**: Rate limiting may impact data collection speed
- **Quality**: AI entity extraction accuracy may vary by content type
- **Adoption**: Learning curve for new users unfamiliar with OSINT tools
