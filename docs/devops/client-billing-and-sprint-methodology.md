# Client Billing & Sprint Methodology

**Document Type**: Development Policy & Commercial Framework
**Version**: 1.0
**Date**: September 28, 2025
**Scope**: All client projects using Django TDD Template

---

## Overview

This document establishes the commercial framework for client project delivery using our Django TDD Template, defining the relationship between client billing cycles and internal development sprints.

## Core Principles

### 1. **Client-Focused Budget Cycles**
- Client engagement organized around **"Big Iteration Budget Boxes"**
- Fixed scope and pricing for each budget cycle
- Clear deliverables and acceptance criteria defined upfront
- No scope changes during active development cycle

### 2. **Internal Sprint Flexibility**
- Development team controls sprint composition and timing
- User stories selected for budget cycle are **locked in** ("no changing horses mid-stream")
- Sprint boundaries determined by technical dependencies and team velocity
- Focus on delivery efficiency, not client progress updates

### 3. **Acceptance-Driven Delivery**
- Client review and acceptance occurs at budget cycle completion
- Functional software delivery measured at cycle boundaries
- Scope adjustments happen between cycles, not during development

## Commercial Project Hierarchy

### **Epoch Level** (Client Billing Unit)

**Definition**: Major project phases that represent complete business value delivery

**Characteristics**:
- Client-facing deliverable packages
- Fixed budget and timeline
- Clear acceptance criteria
- Business value realization points

**Example Structure**:
```
Pre-Epoch: Foundation & Infrastructure Setup
 Budget: $X for foundational development
 Timeline: 2-4 weeks
 Deliverable: Complete development environment + core architecture

Epoch 1: Core Business Features
 Budget: $Y for primary functionality
 Timeline: 6-8 weeks
 Deliverable: Working application with core user workflows

Epoch 2: Advanced Features & Integration
 Budget: $Z for enhancement features
 Timeline: 4-6 weeks
 Deliverable: Production-ready system with advanced capabilities
```

### **Sprint Level** (Internal Execution)

**Definition**: Tactical development iterations for efficient delivery

**Characteristics**:
- Internal team planning and execution
- Flexible composition based on technical dependencies
- Variable duration based on story complexity
- Multiple sprints per epoch

**Sprint Planning Authority**:
- **Development team decides** sprint composition
- **Technical dependencies** drive sprint boundaries
- **Team velocity** determines sprint duration
- **Client is not involved** in sprint-level planning

## Billing & Engagement Model

### **Budget Cycle Structure**

1. **Pre-Engagement Phase**
   - Scope definition and requirements gathering
   - Technical architecture planning
   - Budget and timeline estimation
   - Acceptance criteria definition

2. **Development Phase**
   - User stories locked in for the cycle
   - No client scope changes accepted
   - Internal sprint flexibility maintained
   - Regular internal progress tracking

3. **Acceptance Phase**
   - Client review of deliverables
   - Acceptance testing against defined criteria
   - Feedback collection and documentation
   - Planning for next cycle (if applicable)

### **Scope Management Policy**

**During Development Cycle**:
-  **No scope changes** accepted from client
-  **No feature additions** during active development
-  **No requirement modifications** mid-cycle
-  **Bug fixes and clarifications** permitted

**Between Development Cycles**:
-  **Scope adjustments** based on learnings
-  **Feature additions** for next cycle
-  **Priority re-ordering** for future work
-  **Budget adjustments** for scope changes

## Template Integration Benefits

### **For Development Team**

**Sprint Flexibility**:
- Choose optimal story combinations for technical efficiency
- Adjust sprint timing based on complexity and dependencies
- Focus on code quality and architectural integrity
- Maintain development velocity without client interference

**Quality Assurance**:
- Complete testing cycles within sprints
- Technical debt management between sprints
- Code review and refactoring time protected
- Professional development standards maintained

### **For Client Relationship**

**Predictable Delivery**:
- Clear budget and timeline expectations
- Defined acceptance criteria and deliverables
- Protection from scope creep during development
- Professional project management approach

**Business Value Focus**:
- Deliverables aligned with business objectives
- Acceptance testing focuses on user value
- Feature discussions happen at appropriate times
- Strategic planning between cycles

## Implementation Guidelines

### **Project Initiation**

1. **Requirements Workshop**
   - Define epoch boundaries and deliverables
   - Establish acceptance criteria for each epoch
   - Create user story backlog with priorities
   - Estimate budget and timeline for first epoch

2. **Contract Structure**
   - Separate agreements for each epoch
   - Clear scope boundaries and change management
   - Acceptance criteria legally defined
   - Payment milestones aligned with deliverables

### **Development Execution**

1. **Sprint Planning** (Internal)
   - Select user stories from epoch backlog
   - Consider technical dependencies and risks
   - Estimate sprint duration based on team capacity
   - Plan testing and quality assurance activities

2. **Client Communication**
   - Weekly progress summaries (high-level)
   - No detailed sprint-level reporting
   - Focus on epoch-level milestone progress
   - Save detailed technical discussions for sprint reviews

### **Cycle Completion**

1. **Acceptance Process**
   - Demonstrate all epoch deliverables
   - Execute acceptance testing scenarios
   - Document any issues or clarifications needed
   - Obtain formal acceptance before next epoch planning

2. **Retrospective & Planning**
   - Internal team retrospective on development process
   - Client feedback session on business value delivered
   - Planning workshop for next epoch (if continuing)
   - Contract and budget planning for next phase

## Risk Management

### **Scope Creep Prevention**

**Client Education**:
- Explain epoch/sprint methodology during onboarding
- Set clear expectations about change management
- Emphasize benefits of protected development time
- Provide examples of successful projects using this approach

**Process Enforcement**:
- Politely redirect scope change requests to next cycle planning
- Document all requests for future cycle consideration
- Maintain focus on current epoch deliverables
- Protect development team from mid-cycle disruptions

### **Quality Assurance**

**Technical Standards**:
- All epoch deliverables must pass comprehensive testing
- Code quality standards maintained throughout development
- Technical debt addressed between epochs
- Architecture integrity preserved across cycles

**Business Value Validation**:
- Regular validation of deliverables against business objectives
- User experience testing and feedback incorporation
- Performance and scalability validation
- Security and compliance verification

## Success Metrics

### **Development Efficiency**
- Sprint velocity and predictability
- Code quality metrics and technical debt levels
- Team satisfaction and sustainable pace
- Time-to-delivery for epoch commitments

### **Client Satisfaction**
- Acceptance rate for epoch deliverables

## Template Standardization

This methodology is built into our Django TDD Template providing:

- **Project structure** supporting epoch/sprint organization
- **Documentation templates** for client communication
- **Development workflows** optimized for this methodology
- **Quality assurance processes** aligned with acceptance criteria
- **Automation tools** supporting efficient sprint execution

**Result**: Consistent, professional project delivery with predictable outcomes for both development team efficiency and client business value realization.
